# Advanced-Dynamic-Simulation

Hi guys!

Thanks for joining us for Chulalongkorn University's Advanced Dynamics (2103-617) course. This is a hands-on, portfolio-based course. The course is built with an open-source license so after you fork the repository it's yours!

This repository is a collection of computational modules in mechanical engineering for undergraduate students who are interested in compressible fluid dynamics. These materials are a combination of work from Asst. Prof Thitima J. at Chulalongkorn University Mechanical Engineering Department and Me, Pakorn Boonpetch.

The course content: 
  Translating and Rotating coordinate systems; Principles of dynamics and equations of motion dynamical systems ranging from one-dimensioal motion of a single particle to three-dimensional motions of rigid bodies and systems of rigid bodies; 
  Applications in engineering problems such as rotor-dynamics, gyroscopic systems, multibody systems, electromechanical systems and etc.
  Introduction to energy methods: Lagrangian mechanics; Stability; Simulation and analysis of dynamical systems, focusing on the use of Maatlab-Simscape Multibodies.
